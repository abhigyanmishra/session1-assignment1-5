Data:
 
It’s not easy to measure the total volume of data stored electronically, but an IDC estimate put the size of the “digital universe” at 4.4 zettabytes in 2013 and is forecasting a tenfold growth by 2020 to 44 zettabytes. A zettabyte is 10^21 bytes, or equivalently one thousand exabytes, one million petabytes, or one billion terabytes. That’s more than one disk drive for every person in the world.
 
The trend is for every individual’s data footprint to grow, but perhaps more significantly,the amount of data generated by machines as a part of the Internet of Things will be even greater than that generated by people. Machine logs, RFID readers, sensor networks,vehicle GPS traces, retail transactions — all of these contribute to the growing mountain of data.
 
 
Big Data:
 
Big data is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools. The challenges include capture, curation, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualisation. The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to “spot business trends, determine quality of research, prevent diseases, link legal citations, combat crime, and determine real-time roadway traffic conditions.

 The four dimensions of Big Data
 
Volume: Large volumes of data
 
Velocity: Quickly moving data
 
Variety: structured, unstructured, images, etc.
 
Veracity: Trust and integrity is a challenge
